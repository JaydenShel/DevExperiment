# FullStackSandbox

This repository serves as a sandbox for experimenting with and implementing full-stack development techniques. The project is a work-in-progress, with no specific final product or identity yet. The goal is to practice various aspects of building a web application, including frontend and backend development, API integration, and deployment.

### What's Inside:
- **Frontend:** React, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, Database (PostgreSQL or MongoDB)
- **APIs:** RESTful API integrations
- **Deployment:** Heroku

### Future Plans:
- Continue adding new features and testing different technologies
- Work on UI/UX design and improving responsiveness
- Potentially transform into a fully-fledged web app with specific use cases in mind
